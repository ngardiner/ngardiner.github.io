**Welcome!** This page contains links to my projects, some information on my [background](history) and interests.

## Projects

   * [OpenWRT Configuration System](https://github.com/ngardiner/openwrt_config) for configuring large deployments of OpenWRT systems - [read more](openwrt_deployments) on how and why such a large deployment is required. (_Note: very alpha codebase_)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ngardiner/ngardiner.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
